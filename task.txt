Task – Integration with external party
1) You are given a csv file – this is the input from external system
2) Create a SQL Server database with only one table – Employees. That table should have as many
columns as needed to accommodate data from the file.
3) Create a simple ASP.Net MVC web site with one page. That page should contain
a. Browse File control
b. a button to execute the import
c. a grid/table (described below).
4) When user selects the file and clicks on Import button the program should parse the file, get data
and insert to the database. The page should report on how many rows were successfully processed.
5) The added rows should be shown in the grid on the same page. Data should be sorted by surname
ascending. Grid should support sorting, searching and edit functionality.
6) You are advised to use a third-party library for the grid.

The application should be considered as real-world product. Make sure comment and unit-test your code.
